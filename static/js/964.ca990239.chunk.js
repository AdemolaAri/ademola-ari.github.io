I'm always looking to learn new technologies and use them to build new things. I'm looking to change the world, ONE technology at a TIME :)\n\n# I AM A BUILDER!\n\nI am the best builder around! ;) I love to look at a problem and get stuck in with building a solution\n\nMy friends describe me as the kind of person that is full of logic. I approach every situation with a step by step plan. Whilst I might not be able to always predict my next move, I sure well know what I want the outcome to be. If I were to climb Kilimanjaro, I'd know that the end goal is to get to the top and roughly how many supplies and how much equipment I will need for the trip, however, I don't know what curve-balls may come my way and I'm ok with that. My ability to adapt to problems quickly and efficiently means that I can gladly claim the title of the best builder there is. :)\n\n# I AM A LIFELONG LEARNER!\n\nI am constantly feeding my mind with new knowledge. The excitement I get from learning a new skill knows no bounds.
